playing around, mocking a limit order book system for fun to explore what's involved

## TODO

* buy/sell services shouldn't be GET, should be POST
* should return an order id
* order cancel service
* server should store more info about the orders, not just the book
* market orders should return info about price they were filled @
* price service (bid/offer)
* price for the client/tester should be a little bit more sensible
